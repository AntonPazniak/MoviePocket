### Component Documentation

Document each React component, including its purpose, props, and usage.

- Component Buttons
  - [DislikedMovieButton](..%2FMoviePocket-Frontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2Fbuttons%2FDislikedMovieButton.js)
      - Purpose: The DislikedMovieButton component is a reusable React component designed to represent a button that allows users to dislike a movie. It interacts with the server to check the current disliked state of the movie and enables users to toggle the dislike state by clicking the button.
      - Props: 
        - idMovie (Required, Number): The unique identifier of the movie for which the dislike button is being displayed.
        - className (Optional, String): Additional CSS class name(s) that can be provided to customize the styling of the button.
      - Usage: the DislikedMovieButton is used within a MovieDetails component, where idMovie is set to the unique identifier of the movie being displayed. The optional className prop is used to customize the styling of the button.

This component utilizes the AuthContext to check if the user is logged in before allowing them to dislike a movie. When the button is clicked, it toggles the dislike state and sends a request to the server to update the dislike status.
